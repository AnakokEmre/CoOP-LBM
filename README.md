# CoOPLBM

The goal of CoOPLBM is to correct a latent block model (LBM) where data
could have been missing by taking into account the counting data. This
package allows to fit a CoOP-LBM on a bipartite graph, represented as a
contigency table with the number of interaction observed.

## Installation

You can install the development version of CoOPLBM from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AnakokEmre/CoOP-LBM")
```

## Example

``` r
library(CoOPLBM)
```
